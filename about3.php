                            program, a written board examination and an intensive evaluation process to assess the knowledge, skills and clinical expertise required to provide 
                            the highest quality of patient care.  Achieving board certification demonstrates the orthodontist’s pursuit of continued proficiency and excellence in orthodontics.</h5>

                            <h4>No.  All orthodontists must be licensed to practice, but at this time only 1 in 3 orthodontists in the US have continued on to complete Board Certification. Only 7 American Board Certified Orthodontists are currently practicing in Thailand. </h4>
                            <h5>The American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) certification process signifies a unique achievement—a significant 
                            step beyond the two to three years of advanced education required for a dentist to become a specialist 
                            in orthodontics.  The process requires the orthodontist to demonstrate actual accomplishments in patient 
                            care with detailed case reports on the treatment provided for a broad range of patient problems. Board 
                            certification is a voluntary achievement that all orthodontists do not choose to pursue.  In order to become 
                            board certified by the ABO, an individual orthodontist is thoroughly interviewed by a highly respected panel 
                            of examiners to demonstrate their orthodontic knowledge, clinical skills and judgment.     &emsp;   <strong>... ABA</strong>

It represents a commitment by a licensed specialist that he/she has the necessary knowledge base

                            in patient care, and to continue to deliver these latest advances to patients.  Many orthodontists see it as a demonstration of their dedication to

                            <h5>Since the establishment of the ABO in 1929, the certification process requirements have continued to adjust to the demands of the specialty. Today, 
                            the process involves a thorough <strong>Written Examination (240 questions)</strong> covering all areas of information which an orthodontist should be knowledgeable. 
                            Successful completion of this “board exam” allows the orthodontist to proceed to the <strong>Clinical Examination</strong> where they present detailed case reports 
                            from their practice/residency, demonstrating a history of excellence in patient care. These cases are evaluated by a panel of examiners and later 
                            discussed during an oral examination where the applicant is tested on a wide variety of academic and clinical topics.  After successful completion of 
                            these examinations, the orthodontist has officially achieved Board Certification, for a time-limited period. The orthodontist must go through 
                            <strong>Certification Renewal every 10 years</strong> to maintain their certification status by demonstrating this continued level of patient care.

                            <h5>As a patient, you want to be able to make an informed decision when it comes to the orthodontic care for you and your family.  We want to help you 
                            understand why board certiﬁcation makes a difference. A general dentist is ideal for providing regular oral health check-ups, comparable to your 
                            family doctor.  An orthodontist is a dentist who has gone through a competitive orthodontic program for an additional 2-3 years to be trained speciﬁcally 
                            in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics. A board certiﬁed orthodontist has successfully completed a voluntary, rigorous written and clinical 
                            examination process through The American Board of Orthodontics (ABO). ABO certiﬁcation is recognized throughout the world as representing 
                            the highest level of commitment to orthodontic patient care. Orthodontic treatment options and technology change rapidly, making it essential for 
                            orthodontists to keep abreast of the latest advances. By participating in the ABO’s Certiﬁcation Renewal process every 10 years, board certiﬁed 
                            orthodontists are demonstrating their continuous dedication to the highest standards of care that every patient deserves.

                            <h5>
                            Orthodontists understand the complexity of growth development and facial form. 
                            Treatment plans include issues related to the jaw and bite, not just movement of teeth. 
                            There’s a reason orthodontists spend additional years in a highly competitive orthodontic 
                            program - to learn and perfect their ability in the specialty. A general dentist is ideal 
                            for providing regular oral health check-ups, comparable to your family doctor. Many 
                            dentists offer orthodontic treatment, but they do not have the same extensive education 
                            required of an orthodontist. <br>
                            A board certiﬁ ed orthodontist is committed to the highest level of patient care including
                            a comprehensive treatment approach to ensure quality work. And board certiﬁed 
                            orthodontists must re-new their certiﬁ cation every 10 years to demonstrate their 
                            continuous commitment to lifelong learning and excellence.
